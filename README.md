For the **First Milestone Project** with the **Code Institute**, I have decided to design a static website for a fictional museum dedicated to women in art.



## User Experience (UX)


### User stories

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

I have decided to use a black background and a combination of colours that are repeated throughout the website.
The colours are: 
#fafafa;
#ff8080;
#80ccff;
#b1afaf;
 #7e7d7d.

In the beginning I have used the color #ff8080 also for the button background, but then I realized it was too pale for a call to action. I decided to change it with a red using the Bootstrap property btn-danger.

### Typography

Montserrat and Lato are the fonts used in the website. 
They are both modern and they look really nice especially when adding some space between the letters.
They are easy to read as well.
I have used only in the blockquote the font Jim Nightshade as the font for the signature. It is cursive and it suggests a hand-written signature.

### Imagery

Images are very important, since the website is about a museum.
I have chosen images with strong colours and representing strong personalities, so they suggest the style and the philosphy behind the museum.

### Wireframes

I have started with using Balsamiq, but I realized that my ideas flow much better on paper.
I sketched the pages both for mobile devices and desktop.

### Features
Responsive on all device sizes. I played with content hiding a few elements or words on smaller screens, so it looks better and the user doesn't get annoyed.


## Technologies Used
I have used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4.5.0.
JavaScript with jQuery only for the collapsible navbar.

### Languages Used

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap 4.5.0.
Google Fonts
Font Awesome
jQuery - as part of Bootstrap to make the navbar collapsible on smaller devices.
Git
GitHub
GitPod
Chrome Developer Tool

## Testing
I have tested with the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services.

I have tested the website on various screen sizes from mobile phones to large desktop.
Tested also on Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox.

I have asked to relatives and friends to check the website on their own devices. Everyone had a good User Experience.


## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
The page will automatically refresh.
Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Credits
### Code

The collapsible navabr idea comes from the Whiskey Drop project done with the Code Institute, and also the hero image which has been used in the Love Running project.
I thought these two elements were really nice and user friendly.

The idea for the layout in the pages collection.html and museum.html comes from the MoMA website.

Bootstrap4 has been used to make the website responsive.

I have then used [TheW3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) website and the book "Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Robbins whenever I had doubts with the proper semantics.

### Media

I took the pictures from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), but also from various websites. I have added a figcaption for those pictures that have copyrights.
