For the **First Milestone Project** with the **Code Institute**, I have decided to design a static website for a fictional museum dedicated to women in art.


The final user of the website is ideally a millennial person, mostly a woman, who is passionate about art and positive feministic empowerement.
The museum wants to be inclusive as much as it can and make people feel comfortable, so the style will be modern, friendly and strong at the same time.

## User Experience (UX)


### User stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand what the concept of the museum.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to find informations about opening hours, address, contact details and other useful infos.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to check their social medias to understand which kind of experience they usually deliver to guests.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find infos about upcoming exhibitions.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to book a visit.
#### Frequent User Goals
* As a Frequent User, I want to see if new exhibitions are planned.
* As a Frequent User, I want to have a look at additional facilities I might find on the place, such as the weekly menu of the bistro.


### Design

The layout will be simple and modern. Images will play a huge role, since one of the goals of the website is to be visually appealing to get users book a visit to the museum.

#### Colour Scheme

I have decided to use a black background and a combination of colours that are repeated throughout the website.


The colours used are: 
* #fafafa;
* #ff8080;
* #80ccff;
* #b1afaf;
* #7e7d7d.

At the beginning I have used the color #ff8080 for the button "Book Now" background, but then I realized it was too pale for a call to action. I decided to change it with a red using the Bootstrap property btn-danger.

### Typography

Montserrat and Lato are the fonts used in the website. 


They are both modern and they look really nice especially when adding some space between the letters.
They are easy to read as well.


I have used only in the blockquote the font Jim Nightshade as the font for the signature. It is cursive and it suggests a hand-written signature.

### Imagery

Images are very important, since the website is about a museum.


I have chosen images with strong colours and representing strong personalities, so they suggest the style and the philosphy behind the museum.

### Wireframes

I have started with using Balsamiq, but I realized that my ideas flow much better on paper.
I sketched the pages both for mobile devices and desktop.

### Features
Responsive on all device sizes.


I played with content hiding a few elements or words on smaller screens, so it looks better and the user doesn't get annoyed.

The inspiration for the layout on pages collection.html and museum.html has been taken from the [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/) website.


Images have been taken from the web. Mostly from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). The other images all have a figcaption with credits to the author.


The bistro menu pdf has been taken from the [Mandarin Bar & Bistro](https://www.mandarinoriental.it/milan/la-scala/fine-dining/restaurants/italian-cuisine/mandarin-bar-and-bistrot) in Milan.

The [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME) provided the structure for the README.md file.

The UDX folder and files structure have been provided by my mentor [Spencer Barriball](https://github.com/5pence/monkees-project/tree/master/user-design-experience).

### Code

The collapsible navabr idea comes from the Whiskey Drop project done with the Code Institute, and also the hero image which has been used in the Love Running project.
I thought these two elements were really nice and user friendly.


The idea for the layout in the pages collection.html and museum.html comes from the MoMA website.


Bootstrap4 has been used to make the website responsive.


I have then used [TheW3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) website and the book "Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Robbins whenever I had doubts with the proper semantics.

### Media

I took the pictures from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), but also from various websites. I have added a figcaption for those pictures that have copyrights.
